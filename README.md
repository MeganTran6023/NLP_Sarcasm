# NLP Sarcasm Dataset

## üåü Highlights

- Improved accuracy of Random Forest Model from 59% to 62% through rigorous hyperparameter tuning of Random Forest Model.
- Quickened the hyperparameter tuning and training process by reducing dataset from 27,000 items to 1000 items


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

Sarcasm is something we use in face-to-face conversations to make light of a situation or joke around with friends. We know something/someone is sarcastic from their facial expressions, tone of voice, and perhaps the way they phrase their sentiments. However, this is dificult to detect over text or other forms of media since there is only the physical text we have. Because of this, people mistakenly misunderstand one another which leads to uneccesary conflicts.

By creating this NLP project, I hope to identify a effective way to determine sarcastic comments by identifying what words are common in sarcastic comments with the highest accuracy possible.


## üöÄ Usage

**a) Requirements**
* python 3.X (I used Python 3.10.9)

**b) Preprocessing text dataset**

* steps included removing unnecessary words (stop words) and changing words to their root form for all text data points.
